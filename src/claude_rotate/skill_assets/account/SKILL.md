# Account Status (claude-rotate)

Reports which account **this agent session** is running on and the quota/limits
of every configured account, via `claude-rotate`.

## How to run

Run the command and show its output to the user **verbatim** — it is already
formatted (a status line, one fenced block per account, and warnings). Keep
every code fence intact so each account stays its own card. Do not reformat,
merge the blocks, summarize, or add commentary.

```bash
claude-rotate status --report
```

If `claude-rotate` is not installed or reports no accounts, relay that message
as-is. Never fabricate numbers.

## What it reports

- **Markers**: `@` = the account this session runs on; `>` = the account the
  rotator would pick next; `@>` = both (no rotation on the next launch).
- **One fenced block per account** (narrow, no table borders, readable on a
  phone — each fence renders as its own card): a header with the account name and
  days left on the subscription, then — per window (`5h` and `week`) — a *fact
  line* and a *forecast sub-line* beneath it. The fact line carries a progress bar
  (`█`/`░`), the current usage % and the reset as an absolute clock (with a
  weekday when it lands on another day) plus a compact relative duration, e.g.
  `Thu 13:00 (4d 20h)`. The label-less sub-line carries the projection: the
  `→`-prefixed forecast % and, when the limit is crossed before reset, the clock
  and relative duration at which usage hits 100% — shown as `→XX% —` when the
  window resets first, a lone `—` when there is no trend yet, or `reached` once
  usage is already ≥100%. Both lines share one column grid, so the forecast %
  stacks under the current % and the limit-ETA clock under the reset clock.
- **Warnings**: weekly usage ≥ 90 %, forecast > 100 %, subscription expiring in
  under 7 days, accounts needing re-login, plus the freest fallback account.

## Maintenance

This skill is a thin wrapper; all logic lives in `claude-rotate` itself
(`claude_rotate.report.build_report`, exercised by its test suite). Update the
tool to change the output. Reinstall the skill with `claude-rotate
install-skill`.
